```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("readxl")

```
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("rvest")
devtools::install_github("DataComputing/DataComputing")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
BlackFriday <- read_csv("Desktop/BlackFriday.csv")
View(BlackFriday)
```
1. For these one, this is just a general summary that how many different levels in each variables 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
BlackFriday%>%
 summarise (User_ID=n_distinct(User_ID))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Product_ID=n_distinct(Product_ID))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Gender=n_distinct(Gender))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Age=n_distinct(Age))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Occupation=n_distinct(Occupation))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Product_Category_1=n_distinct(Product_Category_1,na.rm = TRUE))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Product_Category_2=n_distinct(Product_Category_2,na.rm = TRUE))
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(Product_Category_3=n_distinct(Product_Category_3,na.rm = TRUE))
```
2. This one shows the highest prucahse and lowest purchase

```{r}
BlackFriday%>%
  summarise(highest=max(Purchase),lowest=min(Purchase))
```

3. First part is summarise the total number in different gender for different age and list the top 5 
Second part is summarise the total number in different gender 

```{r}
BlackFriday%>%
  group_by(Gender,Age)%>%
  summarise(count=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count))%>%
  head(5)
 BlackFriday%>%
  group_by(Gender)%>%
  summarise(count=n())
```
4.This graph shows that divide gender into different and summarise the purchase, then find the relationship between age and purchase 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
BlackFriday %>%
group_by(Age,Gender) %>%
summarise(total_purchase = sum(Purchase))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y = total_purchase)) +
geom_col(aes(fill = Gender)) 
```
5.This graph shows the relationship between total purchase and city category 

```{r}

BlackFriday %>%
group_by(User_ID, City_Category) %>%
summarise(total_purchase = sum(Purchase)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = total_purchase, group = City_Category)) + 
geom_histogram(aes(fill=City_Category,binwidth = 300000, center = 150000))
```
6. This graph divided city category into martial status, and then shows the relationship between city category and total purchase in different marital status 

```{r}
BlackFriday %>%
group_by(City_Category, Marital_Status) %>%
summarise(total_purchase = sum(Purchase)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = City_Category, y = total_purchase)) + 
 geom_col(aes(fill = Marital_Status)) 
```
7.The graph divide occupation in different gender, and then shows the relationship bewteen occpution and total purchase in different gender 

```{r}
BlackFriday %>%
group_by(Occupation,Gender) %>%
summarise(total_purchase = sum(Purchase))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Occupation, y = total_purchase)) +
geom_col(aes(fill = Gender)) 
```
8.This graph stay in current city years into gender, and then shows the relationship bewteen stay in current city years and totap purchase in different gender 

```{r}
BlackFriday %>%
group_by(Stay_In_Current_City_Years,Gender) %>%
summarise(total_purchase = sum(Purchase))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Stay_In_Current_City_Years, y = total_purchase)) +
geom_col(aes(fill = Gender))+facet_wrap(Gender~.)
```
9. This graph divde product category 1 into age and gender, then shows the relationship between product category 1 and total purchase into different age and gender 

```{r}
BlackFriday %>%
group_by(Product_Category_1,Age,Gender) %>%
summarise(total_purchase = sum(Purchase))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Product_Category_1, y = total_purchase)) +
geom_col(aes(fill = Age))+facet_grid(~Gender)
```
